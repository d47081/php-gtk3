# How to install PHP-GTK on Windows

1. You will need install [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe);

2. Download the last release for Windows of [PHP-GTK](https://github.com/scorninpc/php-gtk3/releases);

3. Extract it to root, to be like `C:\PHP-GTK\php.exe`;

4. Create your first PHP script on Desktop called `simple.php`;

	```php
	<?php

	Gtk::init();

	$window = new \GtkWindow();
	$window->show_all();

	Gtk::main();
	```

5. Open cmd.exe and run your script;

	```bash
	C:\PHP-GTK\php.exe Desktop\simple.php
	```

# How to Build PHP-GTK on Windows

## Preparing Visual Studio;

1. Determining the Visual Studio version

	First of all, you need to know what version of Visual Studio do you need. Go to URL https://windows.php.net/downloads/php-sdk/deps/series/ and see what version of PHP are compiled on what version of Visual Studio. For example, you can see that PHP 8.2 can be compiled on VS16 only, because the file called `packages-8.2-vs16-x64-stable.txt`

2. Downloading and installing Visual Studio

	2.1. Using Visual Studio 2022
	
	Just download Visual Studio 2022 community, and install

	ON Visual Studio 2022 Installer, Just check "C++ Desktop Development"

	2.2 Using Visual Studio 2019

	For PHP 8.1, all you need is install VS16 too, wich are included on VS 2019. So you can download Visual Studio 2019 from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16&src=myvs&utm_medium=microsoft&utm_source=my.visualstudio.com&utm_campaign=download&utm_content=vs+community+2019)

	Open the installer, and install Visual Studio Community 2019 and "C++ Desktop Development"

	If when you are reading that you cannot install Visual Studio 2019, try to install the current version of `C++ Desktop Development` and after that, click in modify `Visual Studio Community`, and on `Individual Componentes` tab, look for `Build Tools MSVC v142` and `Windows 10 SDK`.

## Compiling PHP on Windows;

1. Download SDK Binary Tools

	SDK Binary Tools is a various scripts that make work easy

	Download binary tools from `https://github.com/php/php-sdk-binary-tools`

2. Create a folder to work with codes

	Create a folder like `C:\php-dev` to extract PHP SDK

3. Prepare environment

	Open `cmd.exe` as admin, and go to `c:\php-dev\php-sdk`

	Run `phpsdk-vs17-x64.bat` to prepare PHP environment. If you are running vs16, change to `phpsdk-vs16-x64.bat`, and keeping follow this doc using `vs16` instead `vs17`

	Build tree source dir running `bin\phpsdk_buildtree phpdev`

	This will create some folders like `C:\php-dev\php-sdk\phpdev\vs17\x64`

4. Preparing the PHP source

	Now download the [PHP source](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases), if you want to use another versions, go to [archives](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/archives/)

	Extract the source code inside de `C:\php-dev\php-sdk\phpdev\vs17\x64`, and rename it to be like `C:\php-dev\php-sdk\phpdev\vs17\x64\php-8.2.20-src`

5. Downloading dependencies

	Back to the `cmd.exe` opend, go to `C:\php-dev\php-sdk\phpdev\vs17\x64\php-8.2.20-src`, and run the command `phpsdk_deps --update --branch master` to download dependencies

6. Build and compile PHP from source code

	Inside the source code `C:\php-dev\php-sdk\phpdev\vs17\x64\php-8.2.20-src`, run `buildconf`

	Now you can create the config running `configure --disable-all --enable-cli --disable-zts`. You may want to run `configure --help` to see options and what you need to enable

	So now you can build with `nmake`

	It will compile PHP on `C:\php-gtk3\php-sdk\phpdev\vs17\x64\php-8.2.20-src\x64\Release`. You can run `x64\Release\php.exe -m` to confirm that is working

## Preparing PHP, PHP-CPP and PHP-GTK code;

1. Preparing PHP-CPP

	This is the poor part of this processes, becase there is alot PR unmerged on this repo. So, what you need is verify this [pull requests](https://github.com/CopernicaMarketingSoftware/PHP-CPP/pulls) looking for changes to work on windows, and do some changes manualy. ex: clone repository, and look for PR to make that work on php 8.1 and look for PR to make this work on windows, and do some changes manualy

	After do the changes, put this code into folder that we are using to store sources, to be like `C:\php-dev\php-cpp`
	
 	Important: you have to rename the "string.h" in the folder "zend" to "strings.h" - because there is a Problem when using Windows. And then you have to change all dependencies from
	#include "string.h" to #include "strings.h" - but not this `<string>` - otherwise you get problems with the standard windows header files.

3. Preparing PHP-GTK

	Get the last source of [php-gtk](https://github.com/scorninpc/php-gtk3), and extract it on the same folder, to be like `C:\php-dev\php-gtk3`

4. Preparing PHP

	Download the [PHP binary](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases) of the same version of source code, if you want to use another versions, go to [archives](https://windows.php.net/downloads/releases/archives/) to get the binaries. Pay attention to versions with NTS (non-threaed safe) or with out NTS according with your configure options

	Extract it inside our working folder to be like `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64`

## Downloading GTK on windows;

1. Download MSYS2

	Get the last version of [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and install it

- Downloading libs

2. Open MSYS2 bash and download the libs with commands

	```bash
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libglade
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtksourceview3
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glade
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdk-pixbuf2
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glib2
	```

3. Preparing the libs

	Copy the file `C:\msys2\mingw64\lib\glib-2.0\include\glibconfig.h` to the folder `C:\msys2\mingw64\include\glib-2.0`

## Creating Visual Studio project;

1. Creating project

	Open Visual Studio and `Create a new project` of type a `Blank C++ project`. You can add any name and any place to save the project

2. Importing files

	Right click on project name, go to "Add" -> "Existing Item" and add all `.cpp` from PHP-CPP and PHP-GTK projects, or you can drag'n drop from explorer to Visual Studio, on project name. Import files:

	```
	C:\php-dev\php-cpp\zend\*.cpp
	C:\php-dev\php-cpp\common\*.cpp
	C:\php-dev\php-gtk3\src\**\*.cpp
	C:\php-dev\php-gtk3\*.cpp
	```

	You will need to remove the files

	```
	C:\php-dev\php-gtk3\src\Gtk\GtkosxApplication.cpp
	C:\php-dev\php-gtk3\src\libwnck\*.cpp
	```

4. Build everything

	Now you can compile the solution. Go to `Build` menu and `Build Solution`

## Running and packing;

1. PHP-GTK3 extension

	After build without errors, on project folder will create `Release\php-gtk3.dll` file. Copy this to `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\ext\php_php-gtk3.dll`

	Rename file `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\php.ini-develpment` to `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\php.ini`

	Edit `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\php.ini` adding on end of file `extension=php-gtk3`

2. Dependent libs

	Copy these files from `C:\msys2\mingw64\bin` to the root directory of your `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64` folder:

	Now copy `C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\gdk-pixbuf-2.0` to `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\lib\`

4. Running 

	Now you are able to run php with gtk extension. Open `cmd.exe` and try `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\php.exe -m`

	Create your first PHP script on Desktop called `simple.php`;

	```
	<?php

	Gtk::init();

	$window = new \GtkWindow();
	$window->show_all();

	Gtk::main();
	```

	And run `C:\php-dev\php-8.1.14-nts-Win32-vs16-x64\php.exe Desktop\simple.php`
